- `APP_CONFIG` object with JWT expiry (30 days), sync windows, retry limits

### 1A.2 Database Implementation

#### Schema Migration
Use the Prisma schema provided in the database documentation. Run migrations to create all tables with proper indexes.

#### Database Connection Setup
Create database connection utility with health check function. Implement connection retry logic and error handling.

### 1A.3 Authentication System

#### Password-Based Authentication
Implement user registration and login with bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds). Generate JWT tokens with 30-day expiry. Create middleware for token verification on protected routes.

#### Key Authentication Requirements
- Email validation and uniqueness checking
- Secure password hashing before database storage
- JWT tokens for session management
- Protected route middleware that validates tokens
- Password reset functionality via email

#### API Endpoints to Implement
- POST `/api/auth/register` - User registration
- POST `/api/auth/login` - User login
- GET `/api/auth/me` - Get current user
- POST `/api/auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- POST `/api/auth/reset-password` - Password reset completion

### 1A.4 Basic API Infrastructure

#### Express Server Setup
Configure Express server with security middleware (helmet, cors). Remove rate limiting. Set up JSON body parsing with size limits. Implement global error handling middleware.

#### Health Check Endpoint
Create `/health` endpoint that checks database connectivity and returns system status.

#### Request Logging

## Sub-Phase 1B: Calendar Integration

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: High - Core Data Source

### 1B.1 Google OAuth with Passport

#### Passport Configuration
Install and configure `passport-google-oauth20` strategy. Set up OAuth callback handling with Passport middleware. Configure Google OAuth scopes for calendar read access.

#### OAuth Flow Implementation
Create OAuth initiation endpoint that redirects to Google. Implement callback handler that processes OAuth response. Store encrypted access and refresh tokens in database.

#### Required OAuth Scopes
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email`

### 1B.2 Calendar Discovery & Management

#### Calendar Fetching
After successful OAuth, fetch user's calendar list from Google Calendar API. Store calendar metadata (name, timezone, primary status) in database. Allow users to enable/disable specific calendars for syncing.

#### API Integration Details
Use Google Calendar API v3 directly with fetch requests. Handle token refresh automatically when tokens expire. Implement error handling for API rate limits and failures.

### 1B.3 Event Synchronization

#### Event Fetching Strategy
Fetch events from enabled calendars for next 2 days only. Extract essential event data: title, description, start/end times, location, attendee count. Generate hash of event data for change detection.

#### Sync Logic
Compare fetched events with stored events using provider event IDs. Update existing events if data hash has changed. Create new events that don't exist in database. Mark events as completed after they pass.

#### Data Storage Optimization
Store minimal event data needed for story generation. Use upsert operations to handle create/update logic. Implement efficient change detection to avoid unnecessary API calls.

## Sub-Phase 1C: AI Story Generation

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: High - Core Value Proposition

### 1C.1 AI Provider Integration

#### Multi-Provider Architecture
Create AI provider interface that abstracts different AI services. Implement specific classes for Gemini and OpenAI providers. Handle API key validation for each provider type.

#### External API Constants
Organize all AI provider URLs in constants:
- Gemini: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent`
- OpenAI: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
- Claude: `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`

#### User API Key Management
Allow users to configure their own AI provider and API key. Encrypt API keys before database storage. Validate API keys by making test requests to providers.

### 1C.2 Theme Implementation

#### Three Story Themes
**Fantasy Theme**: Transform events into medieval/fantasy narratives using words like "fellowship," "council," "quest," "battle." Include fantasy emojis (‚öîÔ∏è, üè∞, üõ°Ô∏è).

**Gen Z Theme**: Use modern slang and casual language like "bestie," "no cap," "fr fr," "periodt." Include trendy emojis (üíØ, üí∏, üî•, ‚ú®).

**Meme Theme**: Reference internet culture and memes like "this is fine," "narrator voice," "plot twist." Use humorous but work-appropriate language with meme emojis (üî•, üòÖ, üíÄ).

#### Prompt Engineering
Create theme-specific prompt templates that include event context (title, time, location, attendee count). Design prompts to generate 2-3 line narratives that are engaging but professional. Include emoji selection logic for each theme.

### 1C.3 Story Generation Pipeline

#### Generation Process
Check if valid storyline exists for event and theme combination. If no valid storyline, use user's AI provider to generate new story. Parse AI response to extract story text and emoji. Store generated storyline with expiration time (24 hours after event).

#### Caching Strategy
Cache storylines until event completion plus 1 day. Implement cache invalidation when events are modified. Provide manual regeneration option for users.

#### Fallback Handling
Create simple fallback storylines for each theme when AI generation fails. Ensure system continues working even without AI provider configured.

## Sub-Phase 1D: Notification System

**Duration**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: High - User Value Delivery

### 1D.1 Slack Integration Setup

#### Slack App Configuration
Create Slack app in Slack API console with required scopes (`chat:write`, `channels:read`). Configure OAuth redirect URLs. Set up bot user for message posting.

#### OAuth Implementation
Implement Slack OAuth flow similar to Google Calendar. Store bot token securely after successful authorization. Allow users to select notification channel or default to general.

### 1D.2 Notification Scheduling

#### Timing Logic
Calculate notification time as 15 minutes before event start time. Don't schedule notifications for events in the past. Check for existing notifications to prevent duplicates.

#### Database Storage
Store scheduled notifications in `notification_logs` table with PENDING status. Include event reference, storyline reference, and target channel. Track retry count for failed deliveries.

### 1D.3 Notification Delivery Engine

#### Processing Loop
Create background process that checks for due notifications every minute. Process notifications in batches to avoid overwhelming Slack API. Update notification status after successful delivery.

#### Slack Message Delivery
Use Slack Web API to post messages to specified channels. Format messages with storyline text. Handle Slack API errors and rate limits gracefully.

#### Retry Logic
Implement exponential backoff for failed deliveries (1min, 2min, 4min delays). Mark notifications as permanently failed after 3 retry attempts. Log delivery errors for debugging.
